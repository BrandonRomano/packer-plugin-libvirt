- `communicator` (communicator.Config) - Communicator configuration
  See [Packer's documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/communicators) for more.

- `domain_name` (string) - The libvirt name of the domain (virtual machine) running your build
  If not specified, a random name with the prefix `packer-` will be used

- `memory` (int) - The amount of memory to use when building the VM
  in megabytes. This defaults to 512 megabytes.

- `vcpu` (int) - The number of cpus to use when building the VM.
  The default is `1` CPU.

- `network_interface` ([]network.NetworkInterface) - Network interface attachments. See [Network](#network) for more.

- `communicator_interface` (string) - The alias of the network interface used for the SSH/WinRM connections
  See [Communicators and network interfaces](#communicators-and-network-interfaces)

- `volume` ([]volume.Volume) - See [Volumes](#volumes)

- `artifact_volume_alias` (string) - The alias of the drive designated to be the artifact. To learn more,
  see [Volumes](#volumes)

- `boot_devices` ([]string) - Device(s) from which to boot, defaults to hard drive (first volume)
  Available boot devices are: `hd`, `network`, `cdrom`

- `graphics` ([]DomainGraphic) - See [Graphics and video, headless domains](#graphics-and-video-headless-domains).

- `network_address_source` (string) - The alias of the network interface designated as the communicator interface.
  Can be either `agent`, `lease` or `arp`. Default value is `agent`.
  To learn more, see [Communicators and network interfaces](#communicators-and-network-interfaces)
  in the builder documentation.

- `shutdown_mode` (string) - Packer will instruct libvirt to use this mode to properly shut down the virtual machine
  before it attempts to destroy it. Available modes are: `acpi`, `guest`, `initctl`, `signal` and `paravirt`.
  If not set, libvirt will choose the method of shutdown it considers the best.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - After succesfull provisioning, Packer will wait this long for the virtual machine to gracefully
  stop before it destroys it. If not specified, Packer will wait for 5 minutes.
